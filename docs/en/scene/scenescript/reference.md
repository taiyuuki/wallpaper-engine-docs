# SceneScript Reference

SceneScript is follows the ECMAScript 2018 specification, so you can utilize all functionalities from ECMAScript that you would also find in similar languages such as *JavaScript*. This is very useful as you can make use of various helpful classes. For example, `Date` allows you to access the current date and time, `Math` allows you to access various mathematical utility functions.

This page only covers all additions that SceneScript adds to make working with wallpapers possible.

## Globals

SceneScript introduces a handful of globals which you can access at any point in your code.

| Global        | Description   |
|---------------|---------------|
| [engine](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IEngine) | Access to general features of the application. `IEngine` class. |
| [input](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IInput) | Input related data, mainly the mouse cursor. `IInput` class.|
| [thisScene](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IScene) | The currently loaded scene wallpaper. `IScene` class |
| [thisLayer](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/ILayer) | The layer this script has been loaded on. `ILayer` class. |
| [thisObject](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IThisPropertyObject) | The object this script belongs to. `IThisPropertyObject` class. |
| [console](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IConsole) | Access the console log for debugging purposes. `IConsole` class. |
| [shared](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/class/Shared) | Empty by default, allows you to share data between multiple scripts. `Shared` class. |

## Events

SceneScript uses an event system that allows you to run specific code whenever certain events take place. Most notably, the `update` event is most commonly used to execute SceneScript code at every frame that Wallpaper Engine calculates. The `init` event is good for running code once when the wallpaper is first loaded and the `applyUserProperties` event allows you to react to changes to user properties of your wallpaper. Additionally, there are a handful of `cursor` events which related to mouse movement and mouse input which you can incorporate into your wallpaper.

| Event                | Description   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| [init](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/init) | This initialization function will be called once after the object it belongs to has been created. |
| [update](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/update) | This event function will be called every frame for all scripts that export it. |
| [destroy](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/destroy) | This event function will be called just before the object it belongs to gets destroyed. |
| [resizeScreen](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/resizeScreen) | This function will be called every time the wallpaper resizes because of a change to the current resolution. |
| [applyUserProperties](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/applyUserProperties) | This event function will be called once initially when the wallpaper is loaded and whenever any user properties are being adjusted by the user. |
| [cursorEnter](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor enters the bounds of the object. |
| [cursorLeave](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor leaves the bounds of the object. |
| [cursorMove](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor has been moved. |
| [cursorDown](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor is being pressed down on an object. |
| [cursorUp](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor is being released over an object.  |
| [cursorClick](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor) | This event function will be called when the cursor has been pressed and released on the same object. |
| [mediaStatusChanged](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media) | This event function will be called when the media integration is turned on or off by the user. |
| [mediaPlaybackChanged](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media) | This event function will be called when the users starts, stops or pauses media. |
| [mediaPropertiesChanged](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media) | This event function will be called when the properties of the currently playing media change. |
| [mediaThumbnailChanged](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media) | This event function will be called when the thumbnail of the currently playing media changes. |
| [mediaTimelineChanged](/wallpaper-engine-docs/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media) | This event function will be called when the current time of the playing media changes and is only provided by certain applications. |
